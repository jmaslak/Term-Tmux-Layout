 * In some environments, the library directory isn't being passed
   to child processes, causing tests to fail.  Now passing lib on
   command line to the getresolution.pl subtest

Joel C. Maslak <jmaslak@antelope.net>
 * Skips tests for tmux < 2.0 (the actual module works fine, it's just tests
   that fail because the tests use "tmux new-window" which the module doesn't
   use)

Joel C. Maslak <jmaslak@antelope.net>
